# Kaneo task ready

**When:** A Not Ready (or equivalent) task has clear blockers and met DoR, or owner asks to promote Ready to Start.

**Result:** Status `to-do` (Ready to Start) and DoR Satisfied `true`, or a note of remaining gaps.

## Steps

1. Read task DoR, DoR Satisfied, Issue Type, and incoming `blocks`.
2. Confirm every blocking source is Done (or no blockers).
3. Confirm DoR text is met (FE default: HLR ready + named deps; generics/pages add framework/generics as applicable).
4. If met: set DoR Satisfied `true` and status `to-do`. If not: leave Not Ready / Planned; update DoR only when facts changed.
5. Do not promote Planned backlog Defect/Enhancement unless the owner pulls them into the wave.
